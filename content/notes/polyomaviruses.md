# Polyomaviruses: JC and BK

## Structure and General Features
- Small, **non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses** with icosahedral symmetry.
- Similar structure to papillomaviruses, but **not associated with squamous lesions**.
- Establish **latent infection** in kidneys, lymphoid tissues, and sometimes CNS.
- *Polyoma* = “many tumors” (oncogenic in animals, not in humans).
- Disease occurs mostly in **immunocompromised patients**.

## JC Virus

### Epidemiology & Pathogenesis
- Acquired in childhood, latent in kidneys/lymphoid tissue.
- Reactivates in immunosuppressed hosts, especially **AIDS patients**.
- Infects **oligodendrocytes**, causing demyelination.

### Clinical Syndrome: Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML)
- **Subacute neurological decline**: weakness, visual changes, cognitive dysfunction.
- Progresses over weeks–months to severe disability or death.
- **MRI**: multifocal, non-enhancing white matter lesions (no mass effect).

### Diagnosis
- **PCR detection** of JC virus DNA in CSF.
- Brain biopsy rarely needed.

### Treatment
- **No specific antiviral therapy**.
- Management = **restore immune function**:
  - ART for HIV patients.
  - Reduce immunosuppression in transplant patients.

## BK Virus

### Epidemiology & Pathogenesis
- Acquired in childhood, latent in urinary tract/kidneys.
- Reactivates with immunosuppression.
- **Renal transplant patients**: nephropathy → graft dysfunction.
- **Bone marrow transplant patients**: hemorrhagic cystitis.

### Diagnosis
- **PCR detection** of viral DNA in blood or urine.
- **Histology**: “decoy cells” = epithelial cells with enlarged basophilic intranuclear inclusions.

### Treatment
- **No proven antiviral**.
- Main strategy = **reduce immunosuppression** to allow immune system to clear virus.

## High-Yield Exam Summary
- **JC virus → PML (oligodendrocytes, AIDS patients).**
- **BK virus → hemorrhagic cystitis + nephropathy in transplant patients.**
- Both establish **latent infections** and reactivate in immunosuppression.
- Treatment = **immune restoration**, not antivirals.
