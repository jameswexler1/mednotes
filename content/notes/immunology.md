## Introduction

Although vertebrate organisms have evolved a powerful adaptive immunity which
is essential for their survival, these organisms retain an elaborate system of
innate immunity.
Three main features of the innate immune system are:

1. the active killing of damaged host cells by natural killer (NK) lymphocytes
   in vertebrate specific.
   They do not exist in invertebrates, reflecting further evolution of the
   mechanisms of innate immunity after the emergence of vertebrates.

2. The antigen receptors employed by the cells of innate inmmunity have limited
   specificity (diversity) and recognize common structures -- or a repeated
   chemical nature-- present in foreign antigens and most tyically in bacteria.
   These pattern recognition receptors (pRR) nevertheless afford the ability to
   recofnize "non self" from "self", the hallmark of all types of immunity. In
   contrast, the key feature of adaptive immunity is a genetic machinery able
   to produce a hugely diverse repertoire of antigen receptors that can bind
   with high-affinity and specificity each different antigen. In all
   vertebrates except the agnathans sea lamprey and hagfish,the antigen
   receptors of the cells of inate immunity, ie antibodies and T cell
   receptors, differ from those of the cells of innate immnity not lonly of
   variants available, and hence specificity, but also in structure.
3. The innate and adaptive immunity of vertebrate organisms are strongly
   interdependent. The evolutionary more recent adaptive immunity of
   vertebrates is essential for survival as demonstraded by human or
   experimental mutatioons in key genes responsible for the development of
   adaptive immunity. Whether innate immunity is essential for survival of
   vertebrates is more difficult to assert because the processes of innate
   immunity are numerous and disparate, hence less amenable to genetic
   analysis. However, mutations in a number of genes involved in innate
   immunity impair fitness or resistance to infection. Further, certain cells
   of innate immunity, ie the macrophages, are required for a full adaptative
   response and the effector mechanisms of the adaptive response itself rely on
   other components of the innate immunity, such as complement. Hence,
   evolution of innate and adaptative immunity after vertebrate radiation
   displays a strong functional interdependence.

## The cells of innate immunity

A number of cell types are involved in the host defense from infection in
vertebrate organisms as shown by the wide distribution of pattern recognition
receptors or the ability to initiate antiviral responses. Certain types,
however, play a proeminent role;

### Epithelia

Epithelia provide cover to the external body surface and the linings of the
mucosae of internal organs sucha s the gastrointestinal, respiratory and
genito-urinary tracts and thus constitute the first barrier to the entrance of
microbes into the host organism via the skin, the air, food and water or sexual
contact.
The architecture of epithelial junctions generally provides an effective
barrier against microbial colonisation in addition to which epithelial cells
(or specialised groups of epithelial cells) can produce ptent antimicrobial
peptides and/or other lysozyme, can initiante an interferon-mediated anti-viral
response and express several types of pattern recognition receptors thus
initiating inflammatory responses.

### Phagocytes

Phagocytes, ie cells with the ability to engulf and digest bacteria and other
foreign bodies, are a second major population of cells of the innate immunity.
There is a single type of professional phagocyte in D melanogaster, but there
are at lease two in mammals including mainly: the **neutroá¹•hil** and the
monocyte-derived tissue **macrophage**.

Both the neutrophil and the monocyte are circulating cells and both migrate
into tissues at sites of infection in response to chemical gradients of
pathogen components toward which these cells can migrate.
The neutrophil is a short-lived terminally differentiated cell and the fist
phagocyte to meet pathogens that have broken the epithelial barrier and reached
the underlying conective tissue.
In contrast, the monocyte-derived tissue macrophage is a long-lived cell and
can re-enter the circulation.

Alongside bacteria themselves, neutrophils and macrophages trigger the
inflammatory tissue response through the release of a vast array of chemotactic
and pro- inflammatory cytokines.
**Dentritic cels** are special cells found in a number of tissues, including
the skin where they are known as **Langherans Cells**. They are related to the
macrophage lineage, but, rather than being involved in bulk clearance of
foreign pathogens, their major function is one of antigen processing and
presentation to cells of adaptive immunity, namely, the T- lymphocytes
