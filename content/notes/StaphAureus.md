# There are two main ways it can cause damage:

- Biofilm
- Release of exotoxins

# Biofilm (exopolissacharide layer):

Staph aureus is a part of skin flora.
Imagine you will perform a vein puncture.
Some of the staph aureus can get into the blood stream, or stay in the catheter.
So they start to release a loose polysaccharide layer around it.
This allows the bacteria to cross talk between one another.
And they have this very thick polysaccharide layer, to protect against immune cells and antibiotics.
This makes it difficult for infections to be treated by both antibiotics and the immune cells.

You can see this with catheter, and *catheter associatied infections*.

# Exotoxins

## First type of exotoxin: Toxic shock syndrome type 1 (TSST-1)

When it gets into the body, it can release this toxin.
And this toxin binds and acts as a superantigen.
So it binds to MHCII complexes and creates a bridging interaction between the APC and the T cell.
This hyper stimulates the immune response, leading to a massive release of interleukins and other cytokines.
Causing a massive inflammatory reaction, leading to 3 key things:

- These cytokines act on the skin, causing a massive rash
- They can increase capillary permeability, leading to hypotension
- They can also act on the hypothalamus, leading to fever

All these factors, lead to toxic shock syndrome.

## Second type of toxin: leukocidin

This guy comes and creates pores inside of specific leukocytes, that leads to ions and other things
to flow out, leading to necrosis.
When they undergo necrosis, it leads to a massive amount of inflammation.
Particularly in the lungs, causing parenchymal tissue necrosis, called necrotizing pneumonia.

## Third type of toxin: exfoliative toxin

This toxin toxins specific types of cells: keratinocytes.
In between these cells, there are desmosomes, made by desmoglein-1.
This toxin destroys this protein.
So the connection between the keratinocytes is lost, so they are not able to stick together anymore, forming blisters.
These blisters start to slide off, causing skin loss.
This usually happens in kids up to 6 years of age.

## Forth type of toxin: Hemolysin (Beta-hemolysin)

This leads the destruction of the RBC membrane, leading to the hemoglobin being released, which is afterwards destroyed.
This RBC destruction.

For testing, you can cultivate the bacteria in a blood agar plate, so when it starts producing the B-hemolysin, you will start to have blank spots in the dish, so you have identified the bacteria.
So whenever

## Fourth type of toxin: enterotoxin

It targets some of the enterocytes in the lining of the GI tract.
It produces pores and the destruction of the cell membrane, causing ion leaks, so the cells start loosing their
functions of absorbing chemicals.
SO if there is decreased absorption, and electrolyte shifts, so you have a lot of diarrhea, leading to
gastroenteritis (<6 hours after eating some kind of food). Usually mayonnaise.
