# Define and explain inate and accquired immunity (cellular and humoral, identifying their main components)

## Innate and adaptive immunity

The defense against microorganisms is mediated by sequential and coordinated responses that are denominated innate and adaptive immunity.
Innate immunity, also called natural or native immunity, is essential for the defence against microorganisms in the first hours or days after the infection,
before adaptive responses are fully developed.
Innate immunity is mediated by mechanisms that already exist before the happening of a infection that facilitate fast responses against invading microorganisms.

The mechanisms of innate immunity make the first line of defence against infections.
Adaptive responses develop posteriorly and require lymphocytes activation.
The kynetics of immune responses are approximations and can vary in different infections.

## Innate Immune System

It responds almost immediately to microorganisms and damaged cells, and recurrent expositions give origin to responses that are pratically identical.
Its receptors are specific to structures that are commons a groups of related microorganisms and do not distinguish small differences between them.

The main components of the innate immunity are:
1. Physical and chemical barriers, as epithelia and antimicrobe agents produced in the epithelial surfaces;
2. Fagocytes (neutrophils, macrophages), dentritic cella, mastocytes, NK cells and other innate immunity cells;
3. Plasma proteins, including components of the complement system and other inflammation mediators.

Many cells from the innate immunity, such as macrophages, DCs and mastocytes, are always present in the majority of the tissues, where they act as sentinels waiting for invading microorganisms.

The immunre response combats microorganisms through two main reactions: by recruiting phagocytes and other leucocytes that destroy the microorganisms, in the process
called inflammation; and by the blocking of the viral replication or the killing of cells that are infected by viruses, without the need for an inflammatory reaction.

## General image of innate immunity

The term innate refers to the defence mechanisms that are always present, ready to combat microorganisms and other agressor agents.
The innate system consits in multiple types of cells and soluble molecules present in the tissues and in the plasma that constantly avoid the stablishment of infections.
When a mmicrooranism stablish the infectious site, the innate immune respnses provide the initial response, before the adaptative ones develop.
